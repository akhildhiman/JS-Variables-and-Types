## Basic Operations

Mathematical Operations:

```js
var amount = 2080;
// Mathematical Operations:
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 80 less then the value of amount.
  var newAmount = amount -80;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 200 more then the value of amount.
  var newAmount = amount + 200;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 4 times the value of amount.
  var newAmount = amount * 4;
// Define a new variable and store the reminder when the value of amount is  divided by 21.
  var newAmount = amount % 21;
```
Logical Operation
```js
var johnAge = 45;
var markAge = 35;

// Check who is older either John or Mark
  alert("johnAge > markAge");
// Check who is younger
  alert("markAge < johnAge");
// Check if their age is equal
  alert(johnAge == markAge);
// Create a new variable and assign the age of john to new variable.
  let newAge = johnAge;
// Check if john is equal to or greater then mark.
  let ageCheck = johnAge >= markAge;
// Check if john is less then or equal to mark.
  let ageCheck = johnAge <= markAge;


// Calculate the average age of john and mark and assign to a new variable.
let ageAverage = johnAge + markAge /2;
```
